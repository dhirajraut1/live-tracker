# live-tracker
A simple leaflet app that helps to detect and plot the location using GeoLocation API. It can be viewed on supported browsers.

It uses the browser's builtin feature to retrieve the location of the user.

The location is then plotted in the map using leaflet.js 

The interval for updating location is set to 5 seconds which means the location after 5 seconds is again plotted in the map removing the previous marker.
